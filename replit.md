- **Text Tools**: Text-to-PDF conversion with formatting options and real-time preview
- **All tools feature**: Progress tracking, error handling, drag-and-drop uploads, download functionality

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User registration/login through form submission
2. Backend validates credentials and creates session
3. Session stored in PostgreSQL using connect-pg-simple
4. Protected routes verify session on each request

### Tool Usage Flow
1. User selects tool from tools page
2. Modal opens with tool-specific interface
3. File upload triggers frontend validation
4. Backend processes file and returns result
5. User can download processed file

### Content Management Flow
1. Question papers and materials stored in database
2. Search and filtering handled by backend queries
3. Download tracking and analytics collected
4. Premium content gated by subscription status

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini API for content analysis and recommendations
- **File Processing**: Server-side libraries for PDF and image manipulation
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI for accessible component primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin and TypeScript support
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript compiler for type checking
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and error overlay for debugging

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend built using Vite into `dist/public` directory
2. Backend compiled using esbuild for Node.js compatibility
3. Database migrations applied using Drizzle Kit
4. Environment variables configured for production

### Production Setup
- **Static Files**: Served from Express in production mode
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Process Management**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static content
- **Environment**: Production environment variables for database and API keys

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite dev server with backend proxy
- **Database**: Local or remote PostgreSQL with migration support
- **Error Handling**: Development error overlay and detailed logging
- **API Development**: Express middleware with request/response logging

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns, while maintaining development efficiency through integrated tooling and hot reloading capabilities.
